## Project Feedback + Evaluation

#### Project Workflow:

  > Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Performing -**
Your initial user stories are pretty good. They could be a little more specific and I would love to see some more silver/gold features. Don't be afraid to go back and add more user stories, particularly as you complete the ones for your MVP (bronze). The psuedo-code is great and the final app looks super close to the wireframe. Don't be afraid to deviate from your initial wireframe if you think of a layout/design that makes more sense later.

#### Technical Requirements:

  > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Performing -**
You did a great job achieving the technical requirements of the project and your bronze user stories. It would have been awesome if you had tried to add some more features or try some of the bonus challenges.

#### Code Quality:

  > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did > you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Progressing/Performing -**
You did a great job of naming things semantically. I really like that you split your decks into a separate file. Also that you have very little repeated code. One thing that definitely could have been improved is your use of indentation and being consistent with code formatting.

#### Creativity/Interface:

  > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Performing -**
The interface is really intuitive and does a good job of conveying what the program does and is able to do. I would love to see you work on refining that even more beyond your initial wireframe.

#### Total:

**Performing -**
Overall you did a really great job :+1:!
