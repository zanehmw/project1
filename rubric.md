## Project Feedback + Evaluation

#### Project Workflow:

  > Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

**Performing -**
Your initial user stories are pretty good. They could be a little more specific and I would love to see some more silver/gold features. Don't be afraid to go back and add more user stories, particularly as you complete the ones for your MVP (bronze). The psuedo-code is great and the final app looks super close to the wireframe. Don't be afraid to deviate from your initial wireframe if you think of a layout/design that makes more sense later.

#### Technical Requirements:

  > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Performing -**
You did a

#### Code Quality:

  > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did > you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Progressing/Performing -**
You did a great job of naming things semantically. I really like that you split your decks into a separate file. Also that you have very little repeated code. One thing that definitely could have been improved is your use of indentation and being consistent with code formatting.

#### Creativity/Interface:

  > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Performing -**
The interface is really intuitive and does a good job of conveying what the program does and is able to do. I would love to see you work on refining that even more beyond your initial wireframe.

#### Total:

**Performing -**
Overall you did a really great job :+1:!
