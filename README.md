<!-- Pre-load your app with some data- (collection)
  objects within an array
    properties each card will have
      card number:
      english word:
      korean word:
      answered: true/false
      correct: true/false
      **the only problem is how i will access these cards- stress**

let the user flip through them quickly (back or front)
  create button to flip to the other side of the card
  if the english word is showing then show korean word
  but if korean word is showing

    event listener- something hidden and then shows?(google) -->

create more flashcards

use the keyboard flip the card
  next card and previous card buttons
    event listeners for both cards

correct and incorrect button that the user can click to identify whether they memorized it or not
  Track which cards were incorrect
  all incorrect cards are thrown into a collection database
    next card: chooses from unanswered cards database(?)
    previous card: goes to the previous card number- function


some way to keep track of how many points the user has
  scoreboard?


<!-- re-display them until the user gets them right!
  cards in incorrect card database will be thrown back into the deck through some type of function -->
