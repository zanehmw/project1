Explanations of the technologies used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript
My approach taken: below is my pseudocode I used to create these flashcards. The commented
  out sections have already been installed
Installation instructions: I don't know what this means(?)
Unsolved problems: I did not get around to using the keyboard to flip cards or making a reset button to refresh the page.


# pseudocode

<!-- find a way to loop through cards
create more flashcards -->

use the keyboard flip the card
next card and previous card buttons
event listeners for both cards

<!-- Pre-load your app with some data- (collection)
  objects within an array
    properties each card will have
      card number:
      english word:
      korean word:
      answered: true/false
      correct: true/false
      **the only problem is how i will access these cards- stress**

let the user flip through them quickly (back or front)
  create button to flip to the other side of the card
  if the english word is showing then show korean word
  but if korean word is showing

    event listener- something hidden and then shows?(google) -->


<!-- correct and incorrect button that the user can click to identify whether they memorized it or not
  Track which cards were incorrect
  all incorrect cards are thrown into a collection database
    next card: chooses from unanswered cards database(?)
    previous card: goes to the previous card number- function -->

<!--
some way to keep track of how many points the user has
  scoreboard? -->


<!-- re-display them until the user gets them right!
  cards in incorrect card database will be thrown back into the deck through some type of function -->
